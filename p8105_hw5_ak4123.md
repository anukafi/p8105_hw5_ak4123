Question 1
==========

This zip file contains data from a longitudinal study that included a control arm and an experimental arm. Data for each participant is included in a separate file, and file names include the subject ID and arm. Create a tidy dataframe containing data from all participants, including the subject ID, arm, and observations over time:

``` r
files = list.files("./data", full.names = TRUE)
data_files = 
  tibble(
  treatment =  str_detect(files, "con"),
  participant_id = str_extract(files, "\\d+(?=.csv)"),
  data = map(.x = files, ~read.csv(.x))
  )
data_files =
  data_files %>% 
  unnest %>% 
  mutate(treatment = case_when(treatment == TRUE ~ "Control",
                         treatment == FALSE ~ "Experimental")
  ) %>% 
  gather(key = "week", week_1:week_8, value = "value") %>% 
  mutate(week = as.numeric(str_extract(week, "\\d"))) %>% 
  arrange(treatment, participant_id)
data_files
```
