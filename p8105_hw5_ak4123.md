Question 1
==========

This zip file contains data from a longitudinal study that included a control arm and an experimental arm. Data for each participant is included in a separate file, and file names include the subject ID and arm. Create a tidy dataframe containing data from all participants, including the subject ID, arm, and observations over time:

``` r
# list all files
files <- list.files(path = "./data")
 
data <- map_df(paste("./data", files, sep = "/"),
                     read_csv)
```
