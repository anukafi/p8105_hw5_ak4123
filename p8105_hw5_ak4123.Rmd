#Question 1
This zip file contains data from a longitudinal study that included a control arm and an experimental arm. Data for each participant is included in a separate file, and file names include the subject ID and arm.
Create a tidy dataframe containing data from all participants, including the subject ID, arm, and observations over time:
```{r question 1}

files = list.files("./data", full.names = TRUE)
data_files = 
  tibble(
  arm =  str_detect(files, "con"),
  participant = str_extract(files, "\\d+(?=.csv)"),
  data = map(.x = files, ~read.csv(.x))
  )
```
